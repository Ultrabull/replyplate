# ReplyPlate — Restaurant reputation & social kit

A ready-to-run, done-for-you service kit for restaurants: reply to reviews,
get more 5-star reviews, and post to social — powered by your OpenRouter key.
100% client-side, hosted free on GitHub Pages.

Two pages:
- **`index.html`** — the **landing page** you send to restaurant owners (public).
- **`console.html`** — your private **operator console** (deliver the service + find clients).

Live once deployed:
- Landing: `https://ultrabull.github.io/replyplate/`
- Console: `https://ultrabull.github.io/replyplate/console.html`

## Set it up (5 minutes)

### 1. Make the landing page yours
Open `index.html`, find the **`CONFIG` block** near the bottom, and edit:
```js
const CONFIG = {
  brand: "ReplyPlate",     // your business name
  price: "$199",           // your monthly price
  stripe: "",              // your Stripe Payment Link (see below)
  book:   "",              // your Calendly link (optional)
  email:  "hello@example.com", // where prospects reach you
};
```

### 2. Get paid — Stripe Payment Link (no code)
1. Create a free account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com).
2. Dashboard → **Payment Links** → **New** → recurring, set your monthly price.
3. Copy the link (looks like `https://buy.stripe.com/xxxx`) into `CONFIG.stripe`.
That's it — the "Start now" buttons now take customers straight to checkout.
(Until you add it, buttons fall back to emailing you.)

### 3. Add your API key (console)
Open `console.html` → the Settings (⚙) opens automatically → paste your
**OpenRouter key** ([openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)) and pick a
model. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** writes the best replies; free models are fine for testing.

## Deliver the service (console)
1. **Clients** — add each restaurant (name, cuisine, voice, Google review link).
2. **Reply to reviews** — paste a review → 3 safe, on-brand replies → copy.
3. **Get reviews** — generate SMS/email/table-card asking happy diners to review.
4. **Social posts** — enter a special/dish → a batch of captions + hashtags.
5. **Find clients** — write a personalised pitch and track your pipeline.

## Get your first clients
1. Open Google Maps, search "restaurants near me".
2. Note ones with few reviews or no replies — they need this most.
3. Add them under **Find clients**, generate a pitch, reach out.
4. Aim for your first 3 free trials → convert to paid.

## Honest notes
- **Payments** use Stripe Payment Links (safe, no backend). For automatic
  onboarding/cancellations you'd later want a small backend — ask Claude to build it.
- **Lead lists** are built by hand from Google Maps (no scraping). A Google
  Places API integration can be added later.
- Everything (keys, clients, leads) is stored **only in your browser**.
- The work is real but not fully hands-off — you still approve output and do outreach.
